# DAGM2007 Dataset Classification with PyTorch
This GitHub repository provides an implementation of a deep learning model for classifying images from the DAGM2007 dataset. The DAGM2007 dataset is divided into different classes, with each class representing a specific defect type or a non-defective sample. In this particular dataset, we focus on Class 3, selecting 150 images with defects and 150 images without defects. These images are labeled in a directory structure to facilitate supervised learning and evaluation of classification models. The repository showcases various essential components of deep learning such as the training loop, k-fold cross-validation, plotting the learning curve, confusion matrix, and feature maps using PyTorch.

## DAGM2007 Dataset Overview
DAGM 2007 is an annual symposium on weakly supervised learning for industrial optical inspection. It aims to address the detection of defects on diverse background textures without precise labeling of the training set. The dataset includes ten sets, with six for training and four for testing. Each set contains 1000 "defect-free" images and 150 images with labeled defects. The defects are generated using different texture and defect models. The images are stored in grayscale 8-bit PNG format. The defects are represented by elliptical shapes, indicating the approximate defect regions.

## Repository Features
Training Loop: The repository includes a well-structured training loop implemented using PyTorch. The training loop encapsulates the process of feeding the dataset to the model, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters through backpropagation. It provides an efficient and scalable way to train the deep learning model on the DAGM2007 dataset.

* K-Fold Cross Validation: To ensure robustness and reliability of the model, the repository incorporates k-fold cross-validation. This technique divides the dataset into k subsets, allowing the model to train and validate on different subsets in each fold. This helps in obtaining a more accurate estimate of the model's performance by reducing the impact of data bias.

* Learning Curve Plotting: The repository demonstrates the plotting of the learning curve, which visualizes the model's performance during training. It allows us to analyze the model's convergence, identify underfitting or overfitting, and make informed decisions about further model improvements.

* Confusion Matrix: The repository provides a mechanism to compute and visualize the confusion matrix. This matrix enables the evaluation of the model's performance by comparing the predicted and true labels of the DAGM2007 dataset. It provides insights into the model's ability to correctly classify defective and non-defective samples.

* Feature Map Visualization: Feature maps, which represent the activations of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, play a crucial role in understanding the model's decision-making process. The repository includes code to visualize the feature maps generated by the model for a better understanding of its internal representations.
